# Multiple Canvases with Moving Squares

This Python code demonstrates:

Creating multiple canvases using Tkinter
Animating objects on canvases with random movement and resizing
Managing object interactions and freezing events
Saving data to a CSV file
Key Features:

MovingSquare Class: Encapsulates square behavior and properties.
Random Number Generation: Drives both movement and freezing.
Frozen Time Tracking: Measures how long each square remains frozen.
CSV Data Logging: Saves frozen times for analysis.
Automatic Restart: Resets the simulation when all squares are frozen.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Tkinter (tkinter module)
Usage:

Clone or download this repository.

Run the main.py file using Python:

Bash
python main.py

Visual Output:

The program creates a window with five canvases, each containing a moving square.
Squares move and resize randomly within their canvases.
Squares freeze when a generated number matches their position.
Frozen times are displayed in the console and saved to a CSV file.
The simulation restarts when all squares are frozen.
Further Exploration:

Experiment with different movement patterns and freezing conditions.
Explore visualization techniques to represent frozen times.
Integrate the simulation with other data analysis tools.
Extend the functionality to handle more complex interactions and scenarios.
